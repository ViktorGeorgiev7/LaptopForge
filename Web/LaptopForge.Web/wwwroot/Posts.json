    "Title": "Pick a platform: Windows vs. macOS",
    "Content": "The most flexible operating system, Windows 11, runs on more laptop models than Chrome OS or macOS. Windows notebooks range in price from under $150 to several thousand dollars and offer a wide array of features from touch screens to fingerprint readers to dual graphics chips. Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft's flagship operating system, provides a number of improvements over Windows 10, including the revised interface, the new Microsoft Store, handy features like Snap View.\r\n\r\nSince its launch in October 2021, Windows 11 has also added a host of improvements, including Focus Sessions and a Do Not Disturb mode. The 22H2 update also came with notable performance and battery optimization enhancements. Windows 11 laptops are great for students, researchers, and business users, and they're still the only gaming laptops anyone should consider. \r\nAll MacBooks come with Apple's latest desktop operating system, macOS Sonoma. Overall, the operating system offers similar functionality to Windows 11, but with a different take on the interface that substitutes an apps dock at the bottom of the screen for Microsoft's Start menu and taskbar. Instead of the Cortana digital assistant, Mac users get Siri. They can also perform transactions with Apple Pay, take calls or texts from their phones, and unlock their laptops with an Apple Watch. \r\n\r\nHowever, macOS isn't made for touch, because no MacBook comes with a touch screen. While Apple did bring iPad apps to its laptops starting with macOS Big Sur  (iPad and iPadOS apps can run natively on M1, M2, and M3 Macs), you have to rely on a touchpad or mouse to navigate them. macOS Ventura brought Apple's Stage Manager for handling multitasking, which is an upgrade, but much more difficult to master than Windows solution.\r\nIf you're buying a large, bulky notebook or a gaming rig that you'll use only on a desk near an outlet, you don't have to worry about battery life. However, if you plan to use the laptop on your lap, even if it's at home and or work, you'll want at least 7 hours of endurance, with 9+ hours being ideal. To determine a notebook's expected battery life, don't take the manufacturer's word for it. Instead, read third-party results from objective sources, such as our reviews.",

    "Title": "Plan Based on Your Budget",
    "Content": "These days, you can buy a usable laptop for under $200, but if you can budget more, you'll get a system with better build quality, stronger performance and a better display. Here's what you can get for each price range.\r\n\r\n$150 to $250: The least-expensive notebooks are either Chromebooks, which run Google's browser-centric OS, or low-end Windows systems with minimal storage and slower processors, such as the HP Stream 11 and the Lenovo Chromebook Duet. Use these as secondary computers only or give them to the kids.\r\n$350 to $600: For under $600, you can get a notebook with an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5000 CPU, 4 to 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD, all respectable specs. However, there are sure to be some trade-offs to hit that price. There are outliers like the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet 5 Chromebook or the Samsung Galaxy Book.\r\n$600 to $900: As you get above $600, you'll start to see more premium designs, such as metal finishes. Manufacturers also start to add in other features as you climb the price ladder, including higher-resolution displays and SSDs. The Apple MacBook Air M1 is typically in this price range along with Asus ZenBook 13 UM3402.\r\nAbove $900: At this price range, expect notebooks that are more portable, more powerful or both. Expect higher-resolution screens, faster processors, and possibly discrete graphics. The lightest, longest-lasting ultraportables, like the MacBook Air M2 or Asus Zenbook S13 OLED (2023), tend to cost more than $1,000. High-end gaming systems and mobile workstations usually cost upward of $1,500 or even as much as $2,500 or $3,000.",

    "Title": "Pick your specs",
    "Content": "Notebook components such as processor, hard drive, RAM, and graphics chip can confuse even notebook aficionados, so don't feel bad if spec sheets look like alphabet soup to you.\r\nHere are the main components to keep an eye on.\r\n\r\nCPU: The \"brains\" of your computer, the processor has a huge influence on performance, but depending on what you want to do, even the least-expensive model may be good enough. Intel, AMD RYZEN series or the Apple M1 through 3 chipsets are all you're ever going to need in a laptop.\r\n\r\nRAM: Some sub-$250 laptops come with only 4GB of RAM, but ideally you want at least 8GB on even a budget system and 16GB if you can spend just a little more. For 99% of users, 32GB is more than enough, while 64GB and above is reserved for professional power users, high-end gamers, or those who just want too see how much RAM can conceivably fit in a laptop.\r\n\r\nStorage (SSD): As important as the speed of your CPU is the performance of your storage drive. Actual hard drives have no place in a laptop in 2023, so stick to a solid state drive (SSD).\r\n\r\nDisplay: The more pixels you have, the more content you can fit on-screen, and the sharper it will look. Sadly, some budget laptops still have 1366 x 768 displays, but if you can afford it, we recommend paying extra for a panel that runs at 1920 x 1080, also known as Full HD or 1080p. Higher-end laptops have screens that are 2560 x 1600, 3200 x 1800, or even 3840 x 2160 (4K), which all look sharp but consume more power, lowering your battery life. \r\n\r\nGraphics Chip: If you're not playing PC games, creating 3D objects or doing high-res video editing, an integrated graphics chip (one that shares system memory) will be fine, especially Intel's Iris Xe graphics. If you have any of the above needs, though, a discrete graphics processor from Nvidia or AMD is essential. ",

    "Title": "Take care of hardware",
    "Content": "Keep food and drink away from the laptop. When drinking water or other beverages while working on your laptop, keep your glass or bottle at least one foot away from the laptop. A useful rule of thumb is that even if you toppled over your drink, it should be far enough away from your laptop that the laptop won't experience the spill.\r\n\r\nYou might also want to invest in a specific laptop bag (or a backpack with a dedicated laptop compartment) if you travel often.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, factory laptop batteries tend to have reduced lifespans, so your laptop's battery life will usually not match the factory estimates. Battery life reduces each time you have to charge it, so consider keeping your laptop plugged into a power cable until you absolutely have to use the battery.\r\n\r\nMake sure your hands are clean before using your laptop.\r\nPlace your laptop on a clean, dust-free surface.\r\nMake sure the laptop is well-ventilated by ensuring that the vents are clear of obstructions.\r\nClean your laptop often. Taking a few minutes to clean your computer of dust, grime, residue, and so on will make a huge difference in your laptop's lifespan.\r\nIf you lift your laptop by the screen alone, you could damage the display or the hinges attaching the display to the base. The display is also easily scratched or damaged by direct pressure, so take care not to place pressure on it.\r\nIf you try opening or closing the lid without holding the base steady, this puts pressure on the hinges, which weakens them; it also increases the risk of toppling or pushing the laptop.",
